# The RKI ARS data

This repository contains the age group specific data as reported by the
[ARS weekly reports](https://ars.rki.de/Content/COVID19/Main.aspx).

### Important Caveat:

For now the number of tests are not upscaled to the total level of tests reported by the RKI.

### Disclaimer:

I transcribed the data with a ruler from the pdfs.
I do not guarantee for the correctness.
Also note that the latest weeks are subject to delayed reporting and may change in the future.

### Contributing

Contributions of earlier weeks, new data as it comes in, corrections or other disaggregations are welcome. Just open a Pull Request.
